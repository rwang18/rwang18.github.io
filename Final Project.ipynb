    "## Background\n",
    "Poker is a very common family of card games where players wager money based on the strength of their hand. Texas Hold'em is the most popular variant of poker and is played among friends and in casinos, in person and online, throughout the world. The rules of Texas Hold'em are simple. Players are each dealt 2 cards and are competing to make the best hand possible using their own cards and the five cards displayed on the table. The different poker hands and ranks can be found <a href=\"https://www.cardplayer.com/rules-of-poker/hand-rankings\">here</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Texas Hold'em, there are multiple rounds where players can either: \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>check (no bet)</li>\n",
    "    <li>call (match a bet)</li>\n",
    "    <li>raise (increase the bet)</li>\n",
    "    <li>fold (forfeit hand)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "These options are frequently called actions. In competitive poker play, there are two automatic bets that are assigned based on the players' positions at the poker table. The small blind, player to the left of the dealer, is required to pay a fee based on the game type. The big blind, or player to the left of the small blind, is required to pay around double the small blind fee. This fee is required so that action is guaranteed. The rounds in poker are called:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Preflop - prior to the flop, no additional cards are shown on the table</li>\n",
    "    <li>Flop - after the first three cards are exposed </li>\n",
    "    <li>Turn - after the fourth card is exposed</li>\n",
    "    <li>River - after the final fifth card is exposed. This is the last round before showdown</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "The last player left in the hand or the player with the best hand after the River wins all of the bets, or the pot. For more information on how to play Texas Hold'em please refer to this <a href=\"https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/texas-holdem-poker/\">tutorial</a> by Bicycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Poker, by nature, is a game of probability and psychology. By hedging your bets and bluffing you could either win or lose a lot of money. Understanding your own play style and your opponents' play styles are key to winning. There are certain metrics of measuring poker success. One of the most common metrics is Big Blinds Won per 100 Hands. If you win a large number of Big Blinds, that means you are making money at the poker table, which is the ultimate goal in Texas Hold'em. There also exists metrics that can determine a player's play style. The three metrics that are most common are: \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Voluntarily Put &#36; in pot (VPIP). This statistic measures how often a player puts money into the pot before the flop. The big blind and small blind fees are not included in this fee. A lower VPIP corresponds to a tigher player, meaning a player that only plays great starting hands. A higher VPIP typically indicates that a player is looser, or is willing to play more combinations of starting hands. </li>\n",
    "    <li>Preflop Raise (PFR). This statistic measures how often a player raises before the flop. This statistic usually measures how aggressive a player is. A higher PFR indicates that a player is more aggressive. Meanwhile, a low PFR indicates that a player is timid.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Postflop Aggression Frequency (Agg). This statistic is very similar to PFR but also offers insight to a players pyschological profile. Agg is measured on how often a player raises after the flop. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "A deeper understanding of these metrics can be found <a href=\"https://pokercopilot.com/essential-poker-statistics\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyze how these metrics correspond with winning, I will be using the online casino client logs found <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/smeilz/poker-holdem-games?select=Export+Holdem+Manager+2.0+12302016144830.txt\">here</a>. Though these logs were gathered by a single player, it shows outcomes from all players at the table. With this in mind, there should be sufficient data to uncover trends. Since the data appears as logs, a large amount of tidying will have to occur. After tidying the data, I will perform some exploratory data analysis on the players in this dataset. Finally, I will use regression to determine how players' VPIP, PFR, and Agg correspond with winning in poker. Hopefully, I will be able to uncover trends that can guide beginner players in the game of Texas Hold'em. For more professional poker players, I hope that my findings can help them reevaluate their play strategy. \n",

    "Based on the r^2 value from the statsmodel summary, the data has very little correlation with the model. I expected this since the poker hand data was skewed to begin with as it mainly tracks the play style of a single player. Additionally, some added problems include a large variance in the type of games played in the dataset. The play styles of players in a 0.5/1 small blind/ big blind game differs in a meaningful way from a 2.50/5 small blind/ big blind game. Since the dataset contained information from both of these game types, it becomes hard to succesfully correlated play style statistics like VPIP and Agg. Knowledge about the professional levels of poker experience of all players is assumed to be high. Beginner and intermediate players are usually not concerned about VPIP, PFR, and Agg, so there exists another degree of variance. Ultimately, finding higher quality data (which is not readily accessible online) and proccuring more data points could serve to improve these experimental results. \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "After scraping the web for Texas Hold'em data points, some relevant and important statistical measures were observed. In order to consistently make money in poker, a player must represent him or herself well. Measures like VPIP, PFR, and Agg are all important poker statistics that can make you a better player, whether a beginner player, intermediate player, or professional player. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set used proved to be unreliable, but given the circumstance, it was the only dataset that I could find. In order to truly uncover trends and build a predictive model to find success factors, more datapoints are necessary and less subjective data must be used. This dataset was collected by a single player based on his online casino experiences, which is not a great representation of poker players, as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that came from this analysis, though, was identifying a winning poker strategy for the player at hand. From the exploratory data analysis, it seems as if a good VPIP is around 17%, a good PFR is around 10%, and a good Agg is around 38%, as these frequencies worked well for the player. Analyzing your own play style, finding out your weaknesses and strengths, is crucial if you wish to make money while playing Texas Hold'em. Texas Hold'em is mainly a game of strategy and psychology, with a little bit of luck involved. By performing analysis like this on your own poker experiences, you can learn and build better strategies to win money in online casinos and in live games. "
